## Overview

Montage Data is a framework that allows
[Montage](https://github.com/montagejs/montage) applications to easily exchange
data with servers. It maps server data to model objects accessible in
application code, allowing complex server operations to be performed by reading
and writing the properties of model objects obtained with simple queries and
by traversing relationships.

Montage Data is an Object Service Mapping (OSM), something like an Object
Relational Mapping (ORM) that works for servers offering REST and other types
of non-relational services.

## Documentation

Documentation can be generated by installing JSDoc 3.3.3 or newer and executing
`jsdoc -c .jsdoc.conf.json` in the root of the project, and it can be read by
opening the resulting `out/doc/index.html` in a web browser.

## Testing

All non-disabled tests should always pass.

Tests can be run by executing `npm install` in the `test` subdirectory and then
loading `test/run.html` through a web server. Tests can be created by editing
`test/run.js`.
