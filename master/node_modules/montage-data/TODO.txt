[2016-01-14 Charles] Brief notes from a Montage Data source code review with
  Benoit and Thibault:

    - service nesting, main service created by default, no parent/child.
    - requestData returns promise.
    - DataSteam is not a promise any more.
    - move delegating (used by mainService) functionality of DataService into a dedicated non-public subclass, maybe DelegatingDataService...
    - should be able to deleteDataObject() an object created with createDataObject() and not yet saved with saveDataObject().
    - getDataObject() should return a promise to support asynchronous.
    - createDataObject() should return a promise.
    - getDataObject()
